# House-Price-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People donâ€™t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.

# Conclusion
The House Price Prediction analysis using Linear Regression (Single Variable) is a fundamental example of predictive modeling. While this simplified approach focuses on a single attribute, real-world scenarios involve multiple variables and more complex models. Linear Regression serves as a stepping stone to more advanced regression techniques.

As we engage in this analysis, we recognize the significance of accurate house price prediction in real estate and investment decisions.
